I am a father, and a significant other! I work roughly fulltime and use my freetime to work on learning to program, pixelart, streaming, and editing videos! I generally am a gamer and I enjoy action RPG games and JRPG games as well. I am chill about it and always up to talk about development, design, or even pixel art!
